# Today Feb 25 2024 2:36 am 

I woke up and saw that Elias wanted to wear his clothes to go to work. I asked her do you want to go to work he said yes I got the block from 3:45 I asked him did you Shower and he said no because I don't want to become sick when I come back I am going to do it then I checked my phone that the time was 2:19 am and said you have 1:30 min so you have time why you should not take a shower just that and he starts yelling screaming making sound and a lot of other words "that you want me to become sick you make my day start bad blah blah" believe me He had a very bad behavior I will just be quiet and listen to him. and he left the house at 2:30 and close the door very hardly :( . so my point is that you will be arrived there by 3:00 am and why you stay there for 45 minutes what are you doing? Another point is that It was not the first time that we had sex at night and you always took a shower why when it is the weekend you are not taking a shower? So I doubt that you are doing something else. I will never FORGIVE you. 

## It is okay it will pass but I write it down to have in my back for my future that is WHO YOU ARE. "heart broke, no trust, :(
